# Named Entity Recognition

*Pytorch model based on BERT using Huggingface libary*



1. Download the annotated corpus dataset form [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus)

2. If you are using the colab file to train the model, save the dataset to your personal [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).

3. I suggest training on an AWS EC2 instance 

4. Serving the model via the ```predict.py```
