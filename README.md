# Named Entity Recognition

*Pytorch model based on BERT using Huggingface library*


[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/patzaa/Entity_Recognition_BERT/blob/master/NER_BERT_training.ipynb) 


1. Download the annotated corpus dataset form [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus)
 
 
 
2. If you are using the colab file to train the model, save the dataset to your personal [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive). 

3. I suggest training on an AWS EC2 instance 

4. Serving the model via the ```predict.py``` file
